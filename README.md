# Solar-Panel-Simulation-Tool
This Project simulates a Solar Panel with realistic weather data for a user defined month and location.
The program accounts for several enviromental effects, that can influence the temperature of the solar panel (wind , sunlight intensity, air temperature, humidity etc..)
Solar cells have a set temperature-efficiency behavior, knowing the temperature of the plate a realistic power graph can be calculated.
